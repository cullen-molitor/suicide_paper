        <dc:title>Suicide and Associations with Air Pollution and Ambient Temperature: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Given health threats of climate change, a comprehensive review of the impacts of ambient temperature and ar pollution on suicide is needed. We performed systematic literature review and meta-analysis of suicide risks associated with short-term exposure to ambient temperature and air pollution. Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for English-language publications using relevant keywords. Observational studies assessing risks of daily suicide and suicide attempts associated with temperature, particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤10 μm (PM10) and ≤2.5 mm (PM2.5), ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and carbon monoxide (CO) were included. Data extraction was independently performed in duplicate. Random-effect meta-analysis was applied to pool risk ratios (RRs) for increases in daily suicide per interquartile range (IQR) increase in exposure. Meta-regression analysis was applied to examine effect modification by income level based on gross national income (GNI) per capita, national suicide rates, and average level of exposure factors. In total 2274 articles were screened, with 18 studies meeting inclusion criteria for air pollution and 32 studies for temperature. RRs of suicide per 7.1 °C temperature was 1.09 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.13). RRs of suicide per IQR increase in PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 were 1.02 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.05), 1.01 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.03), and 1.03 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.07). O3, SO2, and CO were not associated with suicide. RR of suicide was significantly higher in higher-income than lower-income countries (1.09, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.11 and 1.20, 95% CI: 1.14, 1.26 per 7.1 °C increased temperature, respectively). Suicide risks associated with air pollution did not significantly differ by income level, national suicide rates, or average exposure levels. Research gaps were found for interactions between air pollution and temperature on suicide risks.</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Air Pollution (Particulate Matter) Exposure and Associations with Depression, Anxiety, Bipolar, Psychosis and Suicide Risk: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Background:

Particulate air pollution’s physical health effects are well known, but associations between particulate matter (PM) exposure and mental illness have not yet been established. However, there is increasing interest in emerging evidence supporting a possible etiological link.

Objectives:

This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive overview and synthesis of the epidemiological literature to date by investigating quantitative associations between PM and multiple adverse mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, psychosis, or suicide).

Methods:

We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched Medline, PsycINFO, and EMBASE from January 1974 to September 2017 for English-language human observational studies reporting quantitative associations between exposure to PM 
less than 1.0 micrometers

, respectively) and the above psychiatric outcomes. We extracted data, appraised study quality using a published quality assessment tool, summarized methodological approaches, and conducted meta-analyses where appropriate.

Results:

Of 1,826 citations identified, 22 met our overall inclusion criteria, and we included 9 in our primary meta-analyses. In our meta-analysis of associations between long-term (

Discussion:

Our findings support the hypothesis of an association between long-term

The limited literature and methodological challenges in this field, including heterogeneous outcome definitions, exposure assessment, and residual confounding, suggest further high-quality studies are warranted to investigate potentially causal associations between air pollution and poor mental health. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP4595</dcterms:abstract>

        <dc:title>Association of suicide with short-term exposure to air pollution at different lag times: A systematic review and meta-analysis</dc:title>
        <dcterms:abstract>Background
Suicide is a major public health problem, with some environmental risk factors.
Objectives
This meta-analysis study explored the association between short-term exposure to air pollution and suicide mortality, with an emphasis on different lag times.
Methods
A systematic search was used to find relevant studies in databases including Scopus, Web of Knowledge, Pubmed, and Embase published up to 19 May 2020. The inclusion criteria included case-crossover or time-series studies assessing the association of criteria air pollutants with suicide mortality at different Lag Days of 0–7 (LD0 to LD7) and Cumulative Lags of 1–7 days (CL1 to CL7). Odds ratios (OR) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
Results
Of 1436 retrieved articles, 11 were eligible for data extraction, representing data on 283,550 suicides published between 2010 and 2019. The odds of suicide death increase with each 10 μg/m3 increase in the mean concentrations of NO2 at CL1 (1.013: 1.006–1.021), CL2 (1.028: 1.003–1.053), CL3 (1.035: 1.001–1.070), and LD2 (1.011: 1.001–1.022), SO2 at CL1 (1.024: 1.014–1.034), CL2 (1.030: 1.012–1.048), CL3 (1.029: 1.009–1.049), and CL4 (1.027: 1.005–1.049), O3 at CL6 (1.008: 1.000–1.016), PM10 at CL1 (1.004: 1.000–1.008), and PM2.5 at CL1 (1.017: 1.003–1.031). Besides, the odds of suicide death increases with each 0.5 mg/m3 increase in the mean concentration of CO at LD6 (1.005: 1.000–1.011). However, it decreased with increased O3 exposure at LD3 (0.997: 0.994–1.000).
Conclusion
The study supports a positive association between air pollution and suicide mortality. No immediate risk was elucidated but the possible effects seem to be exerted cumulatively.</dcterms:abstract>
